Part I: WeatherPy
=================

Observations:
=============

* As one could expect, there are strong positive and negative correlations of Max Temp and Latitude. As one moves away from the equator and moves farther north, max temperatures decrease. And as one moves further south away from the equator, max temperatures also decrease.
* Wind speeds compared to latitude did not vary too much with a standard deviation of 5.35. Something I found interesting about the wind data, is that most of the highest wind speeds occur in the Northern hemisphere. 
* Based upon the linear regression testing of latitude versus wind speed, we can assume that wind speed is not affected by latitude. Latitude and wind speeds were weakly correlated in comparison to the other weather variables related to latitude.
